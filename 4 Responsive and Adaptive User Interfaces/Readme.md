# Responsive and Adaptive User Interfaces

- The content is similar to water. The content should be available to all users, regardless of the device used to view it.

- `The responsive design` displays material dependent on the amount of screen space available.
  Responsive design is flexible and adapts to the size of the screen regardless of the target device.

- `Adaptive design` enables designers to take control of the design and build for numerous points of view.
