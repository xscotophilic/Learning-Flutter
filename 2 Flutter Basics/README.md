  1. Build cache is generated on application run time when a temporary file automatically generated in .dart_tool folder, android folder and iOS folder.

  2. `.dart_tool` contains a `package_config.json file` that specifies packages' locations and versions, as well as Flutter build caches (in a `flutter_build directory`). The `.dart_tool` directory, which is new in Dart 2, is used by pub and other tools. It replaces the `.pub` directory as of the 2.0.0-dev.32.0 SDK release.

  3. The `.idea` folder will be containing all setting related to the IntelliJ IDEA Android studio.

  4. The `Android and iOS folders` contain code for building an app on Android and iOS, respectively. Android folder and ios folder are the folders in which an app can actually be built on the platform of Dart files. They also help you add platform specific features and permissions to your project. When you run a Flutter project, it creates a Gradle or XCode based on the emulator or the device that it is using. `In short, those folders are entire apps which set the stage for the Flutter code to run.`

  5. The `build` folder is the holding the compiled code of your Flutter application. The content of this folder is automatically generated as part of the Flutter build process, so that you donâ€™t need to change anything manually inside this folder.

  6. `Lib` folder will include all dart files for our flutter project and most of us will work in this folder.

  7. The `test` folder contains code that is written to perform an automated test when building for the Flutter application.

  8. `web` folder is for web-app build.

  1. The purpose of `.gitignore` file is to ensure that certain files not tracked by Git remain untracked.

  2. This file tracks properties of this Flutter project. Used by Flutter tool to assess capabilities and perform upgrades etc.

  3. `.packages` file is deprecated. Tools should instead consume `.dart_tools/package_config.json`.

  4. `.iml` is a module file created by IntelliJ IDEA.

  5. `pubspec.lock` specifies the concrete versions and other identifying information for every immediate and transitive dependency a package relies on. The lockfile is generated automatically for you by pub when you run pub get, pub upgrade, or pub downgrade.

  6. Flutter creates a `pubspec.yaml` for a basic Flutter app.

  7. `README.md` is a file that contains programme, utility or APP information for the user. README files often include instructions and additional help, and patch or update details.
