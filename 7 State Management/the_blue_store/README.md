# the_blue_store

A store to buy and sell products.

> Note: Because I utilised commercial font-families, I won't be able to upload it here. Please modify/remove font families from `pubspec.yaml` and Theme in `Main.dart`. Simply remove the font family lines. Follow Commits to track progress of build.
